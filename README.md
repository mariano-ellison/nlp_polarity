Sentiment and Subjectivity Analysis
This small application aims to show some aspects of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that can be performed with Artificial Intelligence tools. We start with a very simple analysis and then move on to more complex options.

In this first instance, we intend to highlight the possibility of working with quantitative and qualitative data in an interrelations way. In a later application, we will show how isolated numerical data does not have greater importance but rather the different interpretations and applications that we can make of it, a task that corresponds to the data scientist.
